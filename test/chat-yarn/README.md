## NodeJS Chat (MIT License)

A node js chat app using web sockets (socket.io)

## Run Locally

Install all the dependencies:

    npm install (you may need to prefix this with sudo if you're on Mac)

Run the app:

    node start.js

Consider using the package `nodemon` if you'd like. It'll auto start your server
every time you save.

    npm install nodemon -g
    nodemon start.js

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

Start up two browsers and start role playing. Keep it PG 13 though.
